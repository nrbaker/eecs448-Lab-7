# eecs448-Lab-7
This code is based off of another C++ code that is converted into Java.
This is the code for a Matrix that prints out a Matrix based on its size and also computes the determinant and inverse of the matrix. Some of the code had to be changed in order for the conversion from C++ to Java to work properly. Although it does produce the same output which is the goal of this lab.
